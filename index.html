Daniel Kang did his bachelors and M.Eng at MIT, with his thesis in computational biology. He then went on to
do another masters at the University of Cambridge, studying statistics and probability thanks to the
generosityÂ of a Churchill scholarship. After a fateful encounter with Professors
<a href="http://www.bailis.org/">Peter Bailis</a> and
<a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/">Matei Zaharia</a>,
he's now slaving away in the Stanford DAWN lab as a PhD student.
Currently, his research focuses on deploying (unreliable) machine learning models efficiently and
with guarantees. His research has primarily focused on video analytics and autonomous vehicles,
but he's willing to change his mind for food. Daniel's research is partially supported by the NSF
GRFP and the Google PhD fellowship.
