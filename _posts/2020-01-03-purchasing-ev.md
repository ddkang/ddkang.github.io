It was shockingly difficult to find a checklist of things to do when purchasing a new electric
vehicle. Here's a list of things I needed to do. This checklist is non-comprehensive, your situation
may be different from mine.


### Step 0: Have a California driver's license

You need a California driver's license to drive in California. You'll need to go to the DMV to
transfer your license. If you want a REAL ID, make sure to have the documents in the [checklist](https://realid.dmv.ca.gov/your-real-id-checklist/).

The DMV is often booked out months in advance. It took me two hours (from arriving at the DMV to
leaving) to do the necessary paperwork / wait in line. YMMV.

Make sure to study for the test. You can fail.


### Step 1: Purchase the vehicle

Self-explanatory. Other resources can give you information on the pros/cons of leasing, financing,
or purchasing with cash.


### Step 2: Have insurance

Since this was my first vehicle, I needed the VIN to purchase insurance. If you have insurance,
you'll need to bring proof of insurance to the car purchase/pickup.

There are many factors to consider when purchasing insurance. Think carefully about what balance of
protection / premium you want.


### Step 3: Tax credits

Purchasing an EV gives you both state and federal tax credits. Make sure to take advantage of these.
The amount depends on the vehicle and time of purchase.



### Step 4: Charging

Figure out your charging situation. You'll likely want to sign up for [ChargePoint](https://www.chargepoint.com/).


### Step 5: Wait for your license plate

You'll have to wait 5-6 weeks for your license plate to arrive in the mail.


### Step 6: Other EV benefits

In California, owning an EV lets you drive in the HOV lane for 4 years. You can figure out what
you're eligible for [here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/?1dmy&urile=wcm:path:/dmv_content_en/dmv/vr/decal).

You will need to wait for your official license plate to arrive before applying for the sticker.




### Step 7: Car accessories (optional)

Some accessories are nice to have for a car. I think these are useful:
- Phone charging cables
- Dashcam or USB stick if your car comes with a camera
- Floor mats
- Front reflector (your dashboard can crack if left in the California sun)

and for safety:
- Flares
- Car jack
- Spare tire

You'll likely want a FasTrak transponder if you plan on driving in California regularly. You can
probably get the FasTrak CAV transponder for a 50% discount. The CAV transponder requires the DMV
CAV certification (which I believe you'll get with your HOV sticker).


### Step 8: Recurring maintenance/administrative tasks

Owning a car comes with many recurring tasks. Luckily, EVs are generally less maintenance than
standard gas vehicles.

Maintenance (depends on your car, read your manual):
- Check your tire pressure (likely every 6 months)
- Rotate your tires (likely every 6-12 months)
- Check/replace your brake fluids (likely every two years)
- Check/replace your filters (likely every two years)

Administrative:
- Update your registration yearly
- Update your address with the DMV if you move
