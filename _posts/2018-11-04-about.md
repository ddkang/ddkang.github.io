Often times I have to perform a technical task that is very similar to something I've done before.
This blog is mainly a list of tutorials for my future self, so I can do these tasks faster. I'm also
hoping to put the expected completion times for the tutorials so I know when something is wrong. The
tutorials will mostly be computer systems and deep learning related.
